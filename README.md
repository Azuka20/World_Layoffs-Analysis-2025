# World_Layoffs-Analysis-2025
### Project overview
This repository contains an in-depth analysis of global layoff trends from  the year 2020-2025, utilizing SQL to query and visualize data. Key insights include industry-wise layoffs, temporal trends, and geographic distributions, aiding data-driven understanding of workforce dynamics. Perfect for showcasing SQL skills in real-world scenarios.

### Objective
The objective of this project is to uncover meaningful insights into layoffs worldwide by leveraging SQL for data querying, cleaning, analysis, and visualization. 
Key questions addressed include:

- Which industries experienced the highest layoffs?
- What is the trend of layoffs over time?
- Which regions were most impacted by layoffs?
- What patterns emerge from exploratory data analysis?
  
### Dataset
Source: Kaggle
Description: The dataset includes information on layoffs, such as the company name, industry, Total number of employees impacted, Percentage number of layoffs per year, location, and date of layoffs.
Link to Dataset:(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022)

### SQL Queries and Analysis
The repository contains SQL scripts and outputs covering:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Examining the dataset to uncover patterns, distributions, and correlations.
Temporal Analysis: Analyzing layoffs over specific periods (e.g., monthly, annually).
Industry Insights: Identifying industries most affected by layoffs.
Geographic Distribution: Understanding layoff patterns by region.
Trend Analysis: Uncovering spikes and patterns in layoffs over time.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was conducted using SQL and visual tools to better understand the data after cleaning. Key insights include:

The distribution of layoffs across industries and regions.
The time periods with the highest layoffs.
Correlations between the size of layoffs and other variables like industry or region.
EDA helped validate the dataset and guide the focus of further analysis.

### Tools Used
SQL: For data cleaning, EDA, and analysis.
Kaggle: Dataset sourcing.

### How to Use
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone [repository URL]  
Load the SQL scripts into your preferred SQL environment (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
Run the queries to explore, clean, and analyze the data.
(Optional) Use Power BI or Tableau for data visualization.

### Insights Gained
The analysis and EDA revealed that;
--  the Highest layoff occurred in 2023-01-04
-- Country with the highest layoff United staes with a total of 408845 in the span of six years 2020-2025
-- According to this data they lay people off the most in April (67728) and January (116789)
-- Just in january 2025 5575 people have been laid of. Then who are those getting these jobs!!!


### Future Enhancements
Perform deeper statistical analysis to identify causal relationships.
Integrate machine learning models for layoff predictions.
Build interactive dashboards to visualize and share layoff trends.
